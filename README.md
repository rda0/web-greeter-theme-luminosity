# web-greeter-theme-luminosity

A theme for [Web Greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/web-greeter)

## Overview

Customizable LightDM Web Greeter theme based on the design of [luminos](https://github.com/muhammadsayuti/lightdm-webkit-theme-luminos) by (Muhammad Sayuti) which was based on the [official LightDM Webkit Greeter theme](https://github.com/Antergos/lightdm-webkit-theme-antergos) of [Antergos Linux](http://antergos.com).

This dark theme was built for use on Linux Workstations at the [Department of Physics ETH Zurich](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/), because there was no suitable theme available that would allow us to use it in combination with a central authentication provider like LDAP or Kerberos. Other themes present a list of users to select from, as it is done with the default LightDM configuration, which does just not scale with our currently active 2464 LDAP user accounts :)

## Prerequisites

- `lightdm`
- `web-greeter` ([releases](https://github.com/JezerM/web-greeter/releases))

### Configuration

Enable `web-greeter` by editing `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` and setting `greeter-session` property to `web-greeter`:

```
[Seat:*]
greeter-session=web-greeter
greeter-show-manual-login=true
greeter-hide-users=true
user-session=ubuntu
allow-guest=false
```

To select another screen for the lightdm greeter in a multimonitor configuration, add the following line:

```
display-setup-script=xrandr --output <id> --primary
```

while `<id>` is the screen, use `xrandr` to list your screen ids.

## Installation

Clone the theme to `/usr/share/web-greeter/themes/luminosity`:

```sh
cd /usr/share/web-greeter/themes
git clone https://github.com/rda0/web-greeter-theme-luminosity.git luminosity
```

To select luminosity as default theme just change the `greeter.theme` property in `/etc/lightdm/web-greeter.yml` to `luminosity`::

```
greeter:
    debug_mode: False
    detect_theme_errors: True
    screensaver_timeout: 300
    secure_mode: True
    theme: luminosity
    icon_theme:
    time_language:
```

Now restart `lightdm`:

```
systemctl restart lightdm.service
```

The theme can be customized in `branding.theme` (optional), see [docs](https://github.com/rda0/web-greeter-theme-luminosity/blob/master/doc/etc/lightdm/web-greeter.conf) for example. To generate thumbnails run `generate-images.py` (requires `graphicsmagick`).

## Using light-locker

You may also want to install `light-locker` to replace `gnome-screensaver` to show the Web Greeter lock screen after automatic session lock.

### Installation

```sh
apt purge gnome-screensaver
apt install python-gi python3-pyside
apt install light-locker light-locker-settings
```

### Configuration

Remove the line starting with `NotShowIn=` in `light-locker.desktop` to start `light-locker` also in gnome:

```sh
sed -i '/NotShowIn=/d' /etc/xdg/autostart/light-locker.desktop
```

Disable gnome screensaver proxy:

```
cat > /etc/xdg/autostart/org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.ScreensaverProxy.desktop << EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Hidden=false
EOF
```

Now kill the screensaver (if it is running) and then restart `lightdm`.

### User configuration

The user can configure `light-locker` with the settings panel `light-locker-settings`.

To check if `light-locker` works:

```sh
$ light-locker-command -q
The screensaver is inactive  (means: it is running)
$ light-locker-command -l
# this will lock the screen
```

You may also use `loginctl lock-session` to lock your screen.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall, simply restore the `greeter-session` property of the `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` file and restart your computer (or at least lightdm).

You may also want to:

- Remove the folder `luminosity` which was created in `/usr/share/web-greeter/themes/`
- Restore the `webkit-theme` property of the `/etc/lightdm/web-greeter.conf` file
